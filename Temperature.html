    <h1>Temperature Convertar</h1>

    <p>Weather, the ever-changing state of the atmosphere, is a fascinating subject that influences nearly every aspect of our lives. From the gentle caress of a warm breeze on a sunny day to the awe-inspiring power of a thunderstorm, weather shapes our daily experiences and plays a crucial role in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide.</p>
    <p>At its core, weather is a complex interplay of various atmospheric elements such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and precipitation. These factors are constantly in flux, driven by dynamic processes within the Earth's atmosphere, interactions with the oceans, and even influences from outer space.</p>
    
    <h2>Having good weather can significantly contribute to living a good life for several reasons</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Physical Health</strong>: Pleasant weather encourages outdoor activities such as walking, jogging, or hiking, which promote physical health and well-being. Sunlight exposure also stimulates the production of vitamin D, essential for bone health and immune function.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Well-being</strong>: Sunshine and mild temperatures have been linked to improved mood and mental health. Good weather can reduce feelings of depression and anxiety, contributing to overall psychological well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Interaction</strong>: Nice weather often facilitates social interactions and gatherings. People are more inclined to participate in outdoor events, picnics, or simply spend time with friends and family outdoors, fostering social connections and a sense of community.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity</strong>: Comfortable weather conditions can enhance productivity in both personal and professional endeavors. Mild temperatures and natural light create a conducive environment for focus and concentration, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Recreation and Leisure</strong>: Good weather opens up a wide range of recreational opportunities, such as beach outings, camping trips, or outdoor sports. These leisure activities provide opportunities for relaxation, enjoyment, and stress relief.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Things you didn't know about weather</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Thundersnow</strong>: Thundersnow is a rare meteorological phenomenon where thunder and lightning occur during a snowstorm. It's relatively uncommon because it requires a specific set of atmospheric conditions. Thundersnow often produces heavy snowfall rates and can create hazardous conditions for travel.</li>
        <li><strong>Petrichor</strong>: The smell of rain, known as petrichor, is caused by a combination of oils released by plants, bacteria, and other compounds that are released into the air during rainfall. This unique scent is more pronounced after a dry spell due to the buildup of these compounds on surfaces like rocks and soil.</li>
        <li><strong>Haboobs</strong>: Haboobs are intense dust storms that occur in arid regions, particularly in desert areas. These massive walls of dust are often triggered by strong thunderstorm downdrafts or cold fronts. Haboobs can cause reduced visibility, property damage, and respiratory issues due to the inhalation of fine dust particles.</li>
        <li><strong>Virga</strong>: Virga is a phenomenon where precipitation falls from a cloud but evaporates before reaching the ground. This results in streaks or wisps of precipitation hanging from the cloud base but never reaching the surface. Virga is commonly observed in arid regions and is often associated with dry thunderstorms.</li>
